Weaviate provides flexible resource management features that let you balance system performance and system resource costs.

Indexes and compression are powerful tools. This page discusses configuration strategies to help you to get the most value from Weaviate Cloud.

## Compression

import VectorsBig from '/_includes/starter-guides/vectors-are-big.mdx';

<VectorsBig/>

Careful choice of indexes and compression can significantly reduce the hosting requirements for your collection.

### Compression algorithms

These compression algorithms are available in Weaviate Cloud:

import CompressionAlgorithms from '/_includes/starter-guides/compression-types.mdx';

<CompressionAlgorithms />

import CostSavings from '/_includes/starter-guides/cost-savings.mdx';

<CostSavings/>

### Price calculator

The Cloud [pricing calculator](https://weaviate.io/pricing) demonstrates the savings. Enter the number of objects in your collection and the dimensionality of each object. Under `Storage Type`, compare the costs for "Performance" and for "Compression." Compressed storage is significantly cheaper.

## Performance

Performance has multiple components. Recall and response latency are important at query time. Indexing speed is important for data imports and updates.

### Recall

import RecallDetails from '/_includes/starter-guides/recall-details.mdx';

<RecallDetails/>

### Query speed

import QuerySpeed from '/_includes/starter-guides/query-speed.mdx';

<QuerySpeed/>

### Import speed

Importing and compressing vectors takes slightly longer than importing uncompressed vectors, but this is a one time cost. In contrast, loading a compressed index into memory is faster since there is less data to load. This means restarts are faster.

## Compression availability

This table shows which compression algorithm is available for each index type.

| Compression type | HNSW index | Flat index | Dynamic index |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| PQ | Yes | No | Yes |
| SQ | Yes | No | Yes |
| BQ | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Activate compression

import ActivateComp from '/_includes/starter-guides/activate-compression.mdx';

## Asynchronous indexing

[Asynchronous indexing](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/schema/vector-index#asynchronous-indexing) changes the import process. In many cases, you can work with newly imported data sooner if asynchronous indexing is enabled. Asynchronous indexing is also a prerequisite for dynamic indexes.

### Enable asynchronous indexing

Enable asynchronous indexing to improve imports and to allow dynamic indexes.

1. For a new cluster, go to the cluster creation page.
1. Under `Advanced Configuration`, find `Enable async indexing`.
1. Select `Enable async indexing`.

import EnableAsync from '/developers/wcs/img/wcd-enable-async.jpg';

<img src={EnableAsync} width="75%" alt="Enable asynchronous indexing"/>

1. For an existing cluster, go to the cluster details page.
1. Under `Advanced Configuration`, find `Enable async indexing`.
1. Select `Enable async indexing`.
1. Select save to restart the cluster.

There is no downtime if you have a high availability (HA) cluster.

If you have a stand-alone cluster, the update requires system downtime. Consider your business needs, and update your cluster when you have a suitable maintenance window.

## Indexing


## Recommendations

Most applications benefit from compression.

- If you have a small collection that uses a flat index, consider a BQ index. The BQ index is 32 times smaller and much, much faster than the uncompressed equivalent.
- If you have specialized needs and a very large data set, consider PQ compression. PQ compression is very configurable, but it requires more expertise to tune well than SQ or BQ.
- Most users with medium to large data sets should consider SQ compression. SQ compressed vectors are one quarter the size of uncompressed vectors. Searches with SQ are faster than searches with uncompressed vectors. Recall is similar to uncompressed vectors.
- For collections that are small, but that are expected to grow, consider a dynamic index. In addition to setting the dynamic index type, configure the collection to use BQ compression while the index is flat and SQ compression when the collection grows large enough to move from a flat index to an HNSW index.
- For multi-tenant collections, consider the sizes of the tenants. The index and compression recommendations are the same for individual tenants as for single collections.
