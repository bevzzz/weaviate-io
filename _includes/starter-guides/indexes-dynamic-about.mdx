[Dynamic indexes](/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#dynamic-index) offer a flexible approach to indexing. A dynamic index starts as a flat index and converts automatically to an HNSW index when the object count reaches a threshold value.

In multi-tenant configurations where different tenants have different object counts, dynamic indexes are a good index choice. Collections with dynamic indexes have less overhead since tenants can use flat indexes when the HNSW index isn't needed.

The default index conversion threshold is 10,000 objects. You can configure the threshold value when you create the dynamic index.

This table shows how a dynamic index changes as the number of objects in a collection grows. The example configuration is for a dynamic index with the following properties:

- A conversion threshold of 10,000 objects.
- Flat index with BQ configured.
- HNSW index with SQ configured
- The training threshold for SQ is 100,000 objects.

| Number of objects | Index type | Compression | Notes |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| 0 - 9,999 | Flat index | BQ | Flat index and BQ are active. |
| 10,000 | Flat -> HNSW | None | The index converts to HNSW. The index is stored in RAM. |
| 100,000 | HNSW | Training | The collection's object count reaches the SQ training threshold. |
| 100,001 | HNSW | SQ | HNSW and SQ are active. |
