A [dynamic index](/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#dynamic-index) offers a flexible approach to indexing. A dynamic index begins as a flat index, and converts automatically to an HNSW index upon reaching a threshold size.

This can be particularly useful in multi-tenant configurations where different tenants may have different numbers of objects. With a dynamic index, you can avoid the overhead of an HNSW index when it's not needed.

The threshold size is 10,000 objects by default. You can configure the threshold size when you create the dynamic index.

This table shows how a dynamic index changes as the number of objects in a collection grows. The assumed set up is a dynamic index with:

- A threshold of 10,000 objects.
- Flat index + BQ configuration.
- HNSW index + PQ or SQ configuration, with 100,000 objects as the PQ/SQ training threshold.

| Number of objects | Index type | Compression | Notes |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| 0 - 9,999 | Flat index | BQ | Flat index by default |
| 10,000 | Flat -> HNSW | None | The index converts to HNSW. The index is stored in RAM. |
| 100,000 | HNSW | Training | The collection object count == PQ/SQ training threshold. |
| 100,001 | HNSW | PQ/SQ | PQ/SQ is active. |
