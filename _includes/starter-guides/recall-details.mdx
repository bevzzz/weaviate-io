Recall measures how well an algorithm finds true positive matches in a data set.

A compressed vector has less information than the corresponding uncompressed vector. An uncompressed vector that would normally match a search query might be missed if the target information is missing in the compressed vector. That missed match lowers recall.

To improve recall with compressed vectors, Weaviate over-fetches a list of candidate vectors during a search. For each item on the candidate list, Weaviate fetches the corresponding uncompressed vector. To determine the final ranking, Weaviate calculates the distances from the uncompressed vectors to the query vector.

The rescoring process is slower than an in-memory search, but since Weaviate only has to search a limited number of uncompressed vectors, the search is still very fast. Most importantly, rescoring using the uncompressed vectors greatly improves recall.

The search algorithm's use of over-fetching and rescoring means you get the benefits of compression without losing the precision of an uncompressed vector search.
