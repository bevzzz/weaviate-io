Each compression algorithm has its own characteristics with regard to speed.

- PQ indexes have response rates approach the response rates of uncompressed indexes when recall reaches 97 percent and higher. At those levels of recall, the [speed profile](/blog/pq-rescoring#qps-vs-recall-experiments) for PQ compressed indexes matches the profile for uncompressed indexes.

- BQ uses fast, bitwise calculations. The flat index relies on brute-force search so it is calculation intensive. BQ's bitwise calculations are extremely efficient. Searches of BQ compressed vectors can be as much as [10 to 20 times as fast](/blog/binary-quantization/#-performance-improvements-with-bq) as similar searches of uncompressed vectors and with equivalent rates of recall. BQ is sensitive to the underlying data. If you use a flat index, evaluate BQ compression to verify the performance improvements with your data set.

- SQ significantly improves search speeds. SQ is new in v1.26. It is faster than PQ, perhaps 3 to 4 times as fast as searching uncompressed vectors. SQ has a higher dimensional resolution than BQ that helps recall. Look for an upcoming blog post that discusses the tradeoffs with SQ compression.

SQ and BQ both have optional vector caches. Use these configurable caches to load frequently used, uncompressed vectors into memory to improve overall search times.
