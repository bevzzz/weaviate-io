Weaviate offers three types of vector indexes, [Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)](#hnsw-indexes), [flat](#flat-indexes) and [dynamic](#dynamic-indexes).

- HNSW indexes enable fast, scalable vector searching that works well even with very large data sets.
- Flat indexes are memory-efficient indexes that work best with small data sets.
- Dynamic indexes switch from flat indexes to HNSW indexes when a [collection](../../concepts/data.md#collections) (or [tenant](../../concepts/data.md#multi-tenancy)) reaches a threshold size.
