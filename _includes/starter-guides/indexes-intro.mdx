Weaviate offers three types of vector indexes, [Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) indexes](#hnsw-indexes), [flat indexes](#flat-indexes) and [dynamic indexes](#dynamic-indexes).

- HNSW indexes enable fast, scalable vector searching that works well even with very large data sets.
- Flat indexes are memory-efficient indexes that work best with small data sets.
- Dynamic indexes switch from flat indexes to HNSW indexes when a [collection](/developers/weaviate/concepts/data#collections) (or [tenant](/developers/weaviate/concepts/data#multi-tenancy)) reaches a threshold size.
