[Flat indexes](/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#flat-index) are memory-efficient. They are disk based indexes that perform brute-force vector searches. Vector search speeds with flat indexes scale linearly with the number of objects.

Flat indexes are best suited for cases where the number of objects is low (less than 10,000) and will not grow significantly.

[Binary quantization (BQ)](/developers/weaviate/configuration/compression/bq-compression) can improve flat indexes' search speeds. BQ improves search time by reducing the amount of data to read, and speeding up time taken to calculate the distance between vectors.
