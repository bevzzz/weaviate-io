[Flat indexes](/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#flat-index) are memory-efficient. They are disk based indexes that perform brute-force vector searches. These searches are fast for small data sets, but the search speed increases linearly as the number of indexed objects grows.

Flat indexes are best suited for cases where the number of objects is low (less than 10,000) and will not grow significantly.
